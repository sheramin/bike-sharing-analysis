Due to huge size of datasets, github was not allowing to upload them. So, I'm pasting the dataset links to be downloaded from and pasted right under this directory:

link: divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html

file names to be downloaded:
Divvy_Trips_2018_Q1.zip
Divvy_Trips_2018_Q2.zip
Divvy_Trips_2018_Q3.zip
Divvy_Trips_2018_Q4.zip

Note: when you've downloaded all the files from above link, please unzip them and put the extracted .csv files under 2018 folder, then good to run the script.
